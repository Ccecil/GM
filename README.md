Just another Mendelmax, MMpro, Tmax variant.  Uses PBC rails.  Currently using MMpro X axis designed by simonous
Also, the Z motor mounts are directly derived from simonious' Mendelmax Z motor mount source files.

Grant Conery did the initial alpha and beta builds of this printer.  There are a few extra older variants of some parts that may be listed later.
